              You will need to have the following documents to be eligible for
              applying for the E-Visa. A Valid passport: You will need basically
              one of the most important documents, which is your valid passport.
              It is also important that you should get it valid for the date of
              arrival in the UAE. If the document gets expired sooner than that,
              you need to get it renewed. Otherwise, your UAE eVisa may be
              denied. A passport scan: it Should be in JPEG format. Passport
              photo: Your photograph to apply for the e-Visa must meet the
              standards of an official passport photo. To help you with that,
              Chiltern Travel and Tour has a Passport Photos service that can be
              helpful for the visa applicant. Valid e-mail address: when
              applying online for e-Visa, you’ll receive an official response
              attached with the valid copy of your visa through your valid
              e-mail address, so you should make sure that you offer a valid
              email address before you apply for the visa. Means of payment:
              Obviously you’ll have to pay for this e-Visa and another document
              while filling in the form. You should be having a valid Paypal
              account or debit/credit Visa or Master card on hand. Bear in mind
              that if you have children traveling with you so children also have
              to have their own valid passport, a photo, and a birth certificate
              either in English or Arabic.
